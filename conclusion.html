                  <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
                  This study will greatly impact the future of Battle Screens development.
                  Battle Screens is a commercial enterprise as such any design improvements could have financial benefits.
                  In particular, the tutorial level will be crucial to get right.
                  We plan on making the tutorial level an optional extra menu option, separate from the play button.
                  This way it won't affect the number of menus an experienced player has to navigate to get in the game.
                  In regards to the screen space, a single-player mode is something we can take forward and implement into the game.
                  When it comes to networking, this particular design choice will be put on hold until it becomes worth the time investment.
                  No games that are published should have bugs, unfortunately, Battle Screens does.
                  If attempts to fix this bug with interface fails, re-designing to accommodate the hardware capabilities will be explored.

                  <h2>Problems With This Study</h2>
                  This usability testing of the game Battle Screens while shallow was very instructive.
                  The results from this have shown me that further usability testing must be done.
                  More specifically on how the controls and instructions interfaces function.
                  In the future, I will start with a Heuristic Evaluation.<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/">Nielsen Norman Group</a>
                  As documented by <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-problems-found-by-heuristic-evaluation/">JAKOB NIELSEN</a>, there is about a 42% chance of a given problem being found for a single evaluator. <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-problems-found-by-heuristic-evaluation/">Nielsen Norman Group</a>
                  By starting with this I will know where to focus my efforts in regards to interface problems.
                  Also next time by involving participants who have less gaming experience I will be targeting more the games target audience(casual gamers) and it will increase the validity of my data.

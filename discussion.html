                  <h2>Understanding the Controls</h2>
                  In the discussion, I will talk about the three usability issues I ran into during my usability testing.
                  To start I will discuss the usability issues with the controls. From both the interview and the questionnaire it is apparent that the understanding of the controls is poor.
                  The average rating for ease of control understanding was 2.59, where 8 is very hard to understand and 0 is very easy to understand.
                  This is the second worst result given behind that of the smoothness of the controls.
                  In addition to the quantitative results, 50% of people during the interview reported a problem with their understanding of the controls.
                  <h2>Understanding the controls Solution</h2>
                  It is clear from the results that the participants had significant trouble understanding the controls.
                  After reviewing the observation footage, I understood why. Not one person went to look at the controls before starting the game.
                  The problem could be blamed with the method of delivery of the controls.
                  A possible design solution could be to create a playable tutorial level.
                  In this level the both players can walk around, shoot targets and learn by doing, rather than reading.
                  By making the controls more engaging and practical, I hope that players will go into a fight with a better understanding of the controls.S

                  <h2>Screen Space</h2>
                  This particular usability issue came from the interview answers. But it can also be seen from the pictures of participants playing the game.
                  Screen space is a problem inherent with all mobile apps, but for our game it is an even more of a problem as each player only has half the screen.
                  In particular, many felt it unfair that the game was  against them for having big thumbs, or nails.
                  <h2>Screen Space Solution</h2>
                  By creating a single player mode in the game, users who have such issues could now not feel so left out.
                  This does not allow them to play the main attraction of the game, the competition that the one vs one creates.
                  Instead by offering some sort of connectivity interface, through WIFI or bluetooth, users could each have a phone.    
                  While this particular design change is achieveable, the required time to complete such an infrastructure, will be considerable.

                  <h2>Rotation Bug</h2>
                  One recurring bug during the usability test often ruined participants experience.

                  Those that did not experience the bug gave the control smoothness an average rating of 3.2, those that did gave the control smoothness an average of 7.2.

                  As stated in the results, there is a strong correlation between enjoyment and how smooth they found the controls.

                  So to keep people enjoying the game, the primary design goal is to fix this bug.

                  <h2>Rotation Bug Solution</h2>
                  During Battle Screens there might be 6 touch events being fired every tick.
                  Throughout the development process the touches not registering properly has been a problem.
                  To fix this bug a complete redesign of the controls could be order.
                  One way would be to restrict rotation and shooting.
                  By not allowing the player to rotate and shoot at the same time, we will reduce the maximum number of touches to 4, this will make it easy to track the touches.
                  Although this will restrict the players movement and shooting, reducing the speed of the gun play during the game.

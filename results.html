                  The correlation between the smoothness of controls and the enjoyment while expected, does show that the game at its heart is fun.
                  However, the with an average rating of 3.47 with 0 being very good and 8 being very bad, the over satisfaction with how the controls behaved was slightly better than average.

                      From the grpah below we can see that there is no correlation between Past mobile experience and the understanding of the controls.
                      This could mean that the controls are difficult to understand even to experts.
                      On the other hand, it could show that the controls are unique. 
                      When the participants were asked "What aspect of the game controls could have been explained better?" 
                      Almost 50% of them chose to reply, below is a brief summary of the problems. They are colour coded to show which answers address the same issue.

                          The answers in red are the participants who thought that the ammo situation should've been explained better.
                          The ones in green are those that did not realise that the rotation sensitivty could be altered in the menus.
                          Tap to fire confused a few more, they assumed that the bullets would travel to the center of the screen regardless of where you tapped.
                          Lastly some did not realise that you could aim down sights. When they accidently aimed down the sight, they did not know how or why it happened.
                          During the observation part of this study you can see this occur. From the clip below you can see how the shock of aiming down the sights stopped the player from shooting.

              One question the participants were asked is  "how would you change the movement speed of the game? 8 being slow it down a lot, 0 speed it up a lot, 4 keep it the same".
              The average of all the results is 4.46.
              This response is very easy to take forward into a development, as it shows that most people found the game slightly too fast.

                <h2>Controls</h2>
                  The correlation between the smoothness of controls and the enjoyment while expected, does show that the game at its heart is fun.
                  However, the with an average rating of 3.47 with 0 being very good and 8 being very bad, the over satisfaction with how the controls behaved was slightly better than average.

                          From the graph below we can see that there is no correlation between Past mobile experience and the understanding of the controls.
                          This could mean that the controls are difficult to understand even to experts.
                          On the other hand, it could show that the controls are unique.

                          When the participants were asked, "What aspect of the game controls could have been explained better?"
                          Almost 50% of them chose to reply, to the right is a brief summary of the problems. They are coded to show which answers address the same issue.
                          The answers in red are the participants who thought that the ammo situation should've been explained better.
                          The ones in green are those that did not that the rotation sensitivity could be altered in the menus.
                          Tap to fire confused a few more, they assumed that the bullets would travel to the center of the screen regardless of where you tapped.
                          Lastly, some did not that you could aim down sights. When they accidentally aimed down the sight, they did not know how or why it happened.
                          During the observation part of this study, you can see this occur. From the clip below you can see how the shock of aiming down the sights stopped the player from shooting.
                          The poor understanding causing the player to die, when victory was in their reach.

                      When asked, "do you feel the game was fundamentally unfair at any point?" there were two issues that were repeated.
                      Firstly, a complaint felt by four out of the 14 people who answered, was the fact their fingers covered up too much screen space.
                      The video to the right gives a demonstration of how two peoples hands on the screen may look.
                      The video recording on the right displays two participants of roughly average finger size.

                      One particular problem came with the introduction of long nails, longer nails often covered up the opposite side of the screen.
                      In this particular case, the participants felt like the game was inherently against them for the way they like to present themselves.

                  <h2>Rotation Bug</h2>
                  During a few play tests, particapants would experience a strange bug where they would start spinning uncontrollably for a few seconds.
                  5 out of the 14 people who answered the interview complained about there being a slight bug in the rotation.
                  The same 5 people scored an average of 7.2 for smoothness of controls. As discussed above the smoothness of controls is strongly related to the enjoyment of the game.
                  During one of the observation sessions such a bug did occur. The clip of the bug can be seen on the right.
